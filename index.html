            Welcome to my portfolio website, my name is Lisa Smithen, and I am training to become a Full Stack
            Developer. <br>  <br>

            I have a diverse background which includes business operations, anti money laundering, compliance, teaching,
            human & operations management, coaching and freelance writing. My layered background has allowed me the
            opportunity to not just see but to also take an active role in the various sides of business. 
           
            By combining these things with my love for helping people into UnCaged Phoenix, I am able to have both profit and
            passion. It is my hope that as a full stack developer, my focus will not just be as an entrepreneur consult
            but to use web development to take my business to another level.

            As a full stack developer I will be able to add immense value to my clients and allow them to effectively
            stand out and compete in the future.
